        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p class="pspace">The founders of Bean Juice Café meet as roommates in 2020 where the pandemic forced them and the rest of the world to remain in lockdown. This gave them plenty of time to get to know one another and to perfect the cup of coffee and a few of their favorite pastries.  </p>

        <h2>How we got our start</h2>
        <p class="pspace">Together, in the spring of 2020 we will be opening a coffee shop on Barstow. We began our journey on Instagram where we started posting fun photos and stories of our creations for entertainment but then people who we didn’t know started following and we just kept growing. Eventually we had some residences of Eau Claire who were interested in purchasing some of our creations. We talked about it and after realizing we were on to something, we did our research, created a business plan then invested in real-estate. We now own our very own brick and mortar coffee shop. This is the story of how Bean Juice Café came to be and now you can come visit us starting this spring!  </p>
